This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Code Challenge for InsightTimer, written in ReactJS.

## To run the application : 
1- `npm run start / yarn start`

2- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/albums/1


##Assumptions: 

1- Used Jest and Enzyme for testing

2- Used Sass as the css preprocessor

3- Used Typescript


## TBC : 

1- The mixins are not comprehensive, I just created them to show case.

2- I have left some // TODO items in the code. For example, the css transition is better if written in a mixin of sort.

3- The Google fonts are normalise.css is left in index.html is a terrible practice. Firstly they're blocking the UI and secondly they're not secure.
At the very least, we can download and package them in our bundle and serve them ourselves.

4- In terms of using an icon library or something like icomoon, there's many things that needs to be considered before making a decision, but for the sake of simplicity and saving time, I think icomoon will do the job for now.
